            <h2>Canvas Chatbot</h2>
            <p>
                A chatbot built to assist students in navigating educational platforms like Canvas, Google Classroom, or Blackboard. 
                It streamlines access to information such as assignments, grades, and teacher announcements, eliminating the complexity of these interfaces.
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Educational platforms often overwhelm new users with multiple options and links, making it difficult to stay organized. 
                The chatbot simplifies this by providing direct access to grades, assignments, and messages, helping users save time and effort.
            </p>

            <h2>Prototyping Phase</h2>
            <p>
                Two prototypes were created: an AI-driven chatbot and a keyword-based chatbot. After analyzing user feedback during the first study, 
                the keyword-based chatbot was chosen due to its simplicity and positive reception.

            <h2>The MazeRunner</h2>
            <p>
                A fully functional game where players navigate a randomly generated maze. It challenges users to solve the maze and reach a predefined endpoint.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>
                The game was developed using Visual Studio Code and the Java Swing library. The maze generation leverages a recursive backtracking algorithm for 
                dynamic and challenging layouts.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                Players start at a designated point and use arrow keys to navigate the maze. Successfully reaching the endpoint triggers a victory message 
                with a celebratory panel.
